# NASA Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD)

This project was built with React and data was pulled from the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov).

## Usage

- In the input field at the top of the page, you can input your birthday or any other date in a yyyy-mm-dd format to see what the Astronomy picture of the day for that day was.

- The default picture of the day is today.

- Please note that the first APOD was posted on June 20, 1995. This means that any date earlier than that will return a null value. That also means this isn't for old men and women, I hope to be more inclusive in the future but for now, I apologize.
